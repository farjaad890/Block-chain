	After following the easy steps a secret phase unique pahse is generated. 
	it is recommended to save your secret phrase securely and do not share it with anyone as it can be used to gain access to your wallet.
Network options:
	Metamask allows to user to switch between networks of mainnet like etherium but also allows the user to connect to test net like goreli and sepolia.
	with connection to testnet the user can easily test out his Dapp which he has created without spending any real money. 
Connect to Ganache:

Detect Metmask:
	There are two ways to detect if the Metamask is installed on the browser:
		1) window.ethreum in users browser indicates an ethreum user. to differentiate Metamask 
		from others use window.ethereum.isMetaMask property.
		2)(Recommended)@metamask/detect-provider
		this module is used to detect Metamsk ethereum provider on any platform.
		install this module with command npm i @metamask/detect-provider
Detect a user Network:
	eth_chainId: is an rpc method to to check on which network the user is connected to.
	Return the chain ID of the current network. It does not tke any parameters.
	
	We can listen to chainChanged provider event to detect network changes.
Access a user's accounts:
	 	To connect the dapp to the users account to perform eth_requestAccounts RPC method.
	 	
	 	percautions:
		Only initiate a connection request in response to direct user action, such as selecting a connect button.							
    		Always disable the connect button while the connection request is pending.
    		Never initiate a connection request on page load.
Metamask SDK:
	MetaMask SDK provides a reliable, secure, and seamless connection from your dapp to a MetaMask wallet client.
	how it works:
	When a user accesses your web dapp on a desktop browser that doesn't have the MetaMask extension installed, a popup appears that prompts the user to either install the MetaMask extension or connect to MetaMask Mobile using a QR code.
